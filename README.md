## Description
React Native fork of [cordova-plugin-background-geolocation](https://github.com/mauron85/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation)
with battery-saving "circular region monitoring" and "stop detection".

Plugin can be used for geolocation when app is running in foreground or background.

You can choose from following location providers:
* **DISTANCE_FILTER_PROVIDER**
* **ACTIVITY_PROVIDER** (Android only)
* **RAW_PROVIDER**

See [Which provider should I use?](/PROVIDERS.md) for more information about providers.

## Breaking changes

### 0.4.x:

* start method doesn't accept callback (use .on("start") event)
* stop method doesn't accept callback (use .on("stop") event)
* for background syncing syncUrl option is required. In version 0.3.x if syncUrl was not set url was used.
* plugin constants are in directly BackgroundGeolocation namespace. (check index.js)
* location property locationId renamed to just id
* iOS pauseLocationUpdates now default to false (becuase iOS docs now states that you need to restart manually if you set it to true)
* iOS no more requires to call finish method. Instead you can optionally start long running task with startTask

## Compatibility

Due to the rapid changes being made in the React Native ecosystem, this module will support
only latest version of React Native. Older versions will only be supported, if they're
compatible with this module.

| Module           | React Native      |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 0.1.0 - 0.2.0    | 0.33              |
| >=0.3.0          | >=0.47            |

If you are using an older version of React Native with this module some features may be buggy.

If you are using react-native-maps or another lib that requires react-native-maps such as Exponent.js or airbnb's react-native-maps then aditionally to the instalation steps described here, you must also change `node_modules/react-native-mauron85-background-geolocation/android/lib/build.gradle` in order to `gms:play-services-locations` match the same version used by those libraries. (in this case `9.8.0`)

```
dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:9.8.0'
    ...
}
```

## Submitting issues

All new issues should follow instructions in [ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mauron85/react-native-background-geolocation/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).
Properly filled issue report will significantly reduce number of follow up questions and decrease issue resolving time.
Most issues cannot be resolved without debug logs. Please try to isolate debug lines related to your issue.
Instructions how to prepare debug logs can be found in section [Debugging](#debugging).
If you're reporting app crash, debug logs might not contain all needed informations about the cause of the crash.
In that case, also provide relevant parts of output of `adb logcat` command.

## Example Apps

Repository [react-native-background-geolocation-example](https://github.com/mauron85/react-native-background-geolocation-example) is hosting example app for both iOS and Android platform.

## Quick example

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import BackgroundGeolocation from 'react-native-mauron85-background-geolocation';

class BgTracking extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    BackgroundGeolocation.configure({
      desiredAccuracy: 10,
      stationaryRadius: 50,
      distanceFilter: 50,
      notificationTitle: 'Background tracking',
      notificationText: 'enabled',
      debug: true,
      startOnBoot: false,
      stopOnTerminate: false,
      locationProvider: BackgroundGeolocation.ACTIVITY_PROVIDER,
      interval: 10000,
      fastestInterval: 5000,
      activitiesInterval: 10000,
      stopOnStillActivity: false,
      url: 'http://192.168.81.15:3000/location',
      httpHeaders: {
        'X-FOO': 'bar'
      }
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.on('location', (location) => {
      // handle your locations here
      // to perform long running operation on iOS
      // you need to create background task
      BackgroundGeolocation.startTask(taskKey => {
        // execute long running task
        // eg. ajax post location
        // IMPORTANT: task has to be ended by endTask
        BackgroundGeolocation.endTask(taskKey);
      });
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.on('stationary', (stationaryLocation) => {
      // handle stationary locations here
      Actions.sendLocation(stationaryLocation);
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.on('error', (error) => {
      console.log('[ERROR] BackgroundGeolocation error:', error);
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.on('start', () => {
      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation service has been started');
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.on('stop', () => {
      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation service has been stopped');
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.on('authorization', (status) => {
      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation authorization status: ' + status);
      if (status !== BackgroundGeolocation.AUTHORIZED) {
        Alert.alert('Location services are disabled', 'Would you like to open location settings?', [
          { text: 'Yes', onPress: () => BackgroundGeolocation.showLocationSettings() },
          { text: 'No', onPress: () => console.log('No Pressed'), style: 'cancel' }
        ]);
      }
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.on('background', () => {
      console.log('[INFO] App is in background');
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.on('foreground', () => {
      console.log('[INFO] App is in foreground');
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.checkStatus(status => {
      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation service is running', status.isRunning);
      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation service has permissions', status.hasPermissions);
      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation auth status: ' + status.authorization);

      // you don't need to check status before start (this is just the example)
      if (!status.isRunning) {
        BackgroundGeolocation.start(); //triggers start on start event
      }
    });

    // you can also just start without checking for status
    // BackgroundGeolocation.start();
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // unregister all event listeners
    BackgroundGeolocation.events.forEach(event => BackgroundGeolocation.removeAllListeners(event));
  }
}

export default BgTracking;
```

### start()
Platform: iOS, Android

Start background geolocation.

### stop()
Platform: iOS, Android

Stop background geolocation.

### isLocationEnabled(success, fail)
Deprecated: This method is deprecated and will be removed in next major version.
Use `checkStatus` as replacement.

Platform: iOS, Android

One time check for status of location services. In case of error, fail callback will be executed.

| Success callback parameter | Type      | Description                                          |
|----------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|

| `hasPermissions`           | `Boolean` | true/false (true if service has permissions)         |
| `authorization`            | `Number`  | BackgroundGeolocation.{NOT_AUTHORIZED | AUTHORIZED}  |

### showAppSettings()
Platform: Android >= 6, iOS >= 8.0

Show app settings to allow change of app location permissions.

### showLocationSettings()
Platform: iOS, Android

Show system settings to allow configuration of current location sources.

### getLocations(success, fail)
Platform: iOS, Android

Method will return all stored locations.
This method is useful for initial rendering of user location on a map just after application launch.

NOTE: Returned locations does not contain location.id.

| Success callback parameter | Type    | Description                    |
|----------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| `locations`                | `Array` | collection of stored locations |

```javascript
BackgroundGeolocation.getLocations(
  function (locations) {
    console.log(locations);
  }
);
```

### getValidLocations(success, fail)
Platform: iOS, Android

Method will return locations, which has not been yet posted to server.
NOTE: Locations does contain location.id.

| Success callback parameter | Type    | Description                    |
|----------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| `locations`                | `Array` | collection of stored locations |

### deleteLocation(locationId, success, fail)
Platform: iOS, Android

Delete location with locationId.

Note: Locations are not actually deleted from database to avoid gaps in locationId numbering.
Instead locations are marked as deleted. Locations marked as deleted will not appear in output of `BackgroundGeolocation.getLocations`.

### deleteAllLocations(success, fail)
Note: You don't need to delete all locations. Plugin manages number of locations automatically and location count never exceeds number as defined by `option.maxLocations`.

Platform: iOS, Android

Delete all stored locations.

### switchMode(modeId, success, fail)
Platform: iOS

Normally plugin will handle switching between **BACKGROUND** and **FOREGROUND** mode itself.
Calling switchMode you can override plugin behavior and force plugin to switch into other mode.

In **FOREGROUND** mode plugin uses iOS local manager to receive locations and behavior is affected
by `option.desiredAccuracy` and `option.distanceFilter`.

In **BACKGROUND** mode plugin uses significant changes and region monitoring to receive locations
and uses `option.stationaryRadius` only.

```
// switch to FOREGROUND mode
BackgroundGeolocation.switchMode(BackgroundGeolocation.FOREGROUND_MODE);

// switch to BACKGROUND mode
BackgroundGeolocation.switchMode(BackgroundGeolocation.BACKGROUND_MODE);
```

### getLogEntries(limit, success, fail)
Platform: Android, iOS

Return all logged events. Useful for plugin debugging.
Parameter `limit` limits number of returned entries.
**@see [Debugging](#debugging)** for more information.

### removeAllListeners(event)

Unregister all event listeners for given event

## Events

Event listeners can registered with:

```
const eventSubscription = BackgroundGeolocation.on('event', callbackFn);
```

And unregistered:

```
eventSubscription.remove();
```

Note: Components should unregister all event listeners in `componentWillUnmount` method,
individually, or with `removeAllListeners`

| `background`        |                     | android  | app entered background state           |


## HTTP locations posting

All locations updates are recorded in local db at all times. When App is in foreground or background in addition to storing location in local db,
location callback function is triggered. Number of location stored in db is limited by `option.maxLocations` a never exceeds this number.
Instead old locations are replaced by new ones.

When `option.url` is defined, each location is also immediately posted to url defined by `option.url`.
If post is successful, the location is marked as deleted in local db.

When `option.syncUrl` is defined all failed to post locations will be coalesced and send in some time later in one single batch.
Batch sync takes place only when number of failed to post locations reaches `option.syncTreshold`.
Locations are send only in single batch, when number of locations reaches `option.syncTreshold`. (No individual location will be send)

Request body of posted locations is always array, even when only one location is sent.

### Example of backend server

[Background-geolocation-server](https://github.com/mauron85/background-geolocation-server) is a backend server written in nodejs.
There are instructions how to run it and simulate locations on Android, iOS Simulator and Genymotion.
